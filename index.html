        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>The Veteran's Administration have <a href="https://www.va.gov/QUALITYOFCARE/measure-up/End_of_Year_Hospital_star_Rating_FY2018.asp" target="_blank">published a ranking list</a> of VA Medical Centers based on quality of care outcomes. This list ranks medical centers using a star ratings system of 1 to 5 stars (higher is better). The VA gets credit for creating the list. Unfortunately, the information on their list is incomplete and the way the information is presented is not user-friendly.</p><br>
            
        <h4>Why This Website?</h4>
        <p>The purpose of this website is to present complete (as much as possible) information to veterans, in a user-friendly format, in order to help veterans make the best choices for their healthcare. I thought that if the original ranking list was tedious and time-consuming for me to sort through it might be the same for others. I thought there had to be a better way to present this important information.</p><p>I hope my fellow veterans find value in this sortable rankings list.</p><br>
        
        <h4>Privacy Statement</h4>

This website does count the number of visitors to the site, along with noting the countries from which they are visiting and which Internet browsers are used to access the website (having this helps me make sure this website looks the same on all browsers).

        <h5>Please Note:</h5>
        <p>Links to each VA medical center is given alongside each ranking. Also, for VA medical centers located in states which have their own health insurance programs, you will find links to the health insurance websites alongside the rankings. For all other states, please consult the <a href="https://www.healthcare.gov" target="_blank">Healthcare.gov website</a> if you need access to an ACA/Obamacare health insurance policy.</p>
