This is a passion project. As a US military veteran who was gearing up to relocate, I wanted to be near a highly-rated VA medical center. I used the VA's own 2018 star ratings to produce a searchable and sortable chart that I could use to easily find the relevant information for the VA medical centers near the cities I was researching for relocation. Unfortunately, after 2018 the VA discontinued publicly disclosing their star ratings and this was the first and last version of my site.
